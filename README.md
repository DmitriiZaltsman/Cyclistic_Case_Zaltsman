# SQL_Cyclistic_Case_Study
## Overview
For the past few months I took a Data Analytics course to make a career change. By the end of the course one should complete a case study to showcase the acquired skillset.
It took a while to develop the efficient approach and I want to cover the challenges I encountered while completing the project as well.

I chose the case study with the following scenario. 

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.
## Tools Used
For Prepare, Process and Analyse stages of the project SQL, R and Sheets were used.
